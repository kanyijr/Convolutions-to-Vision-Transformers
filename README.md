# Convolutions-to-Vision-Transformers
This is an implementation of the Convolutions to Vision Transformers paper by Microsoft Cloud + AI team
which proposes a new approach to computer vision using transformers but switching the linear projections
components with convolutions.
The code includes the model architecture and initialization of the model.The model is untrained though.
In the code, there is a simple training scheme you may use to train the model.However lots of the information
on the paper is not clearly stated so i did alot of reading in between the lines.
To train the model, you have to define your training data ofcourse and creating the required dataloaders.
